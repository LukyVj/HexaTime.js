HexaTime.js
===========

A jQuery plugin to create colored Text, backgrounds, borders ect, with a color based on the time ! (if 22:30:40, color #223040 )


## Origin 
The origin of the idea popped out when I was browsing this website : http://www.jacopocolo.com/hexclock/
I just wanted to extend the concept.
